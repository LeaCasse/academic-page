abstract: >
  We propose a single-qubit QRU architecture for time-series forecasting and streaming data.
  The model outperforms PQC, VQC, and QRB baselines on Mackey–Glass chaotic series and real river-level datasets,
  achieving faster convergence and higher expressivity with the same number of parameters.
  The work introduces spectral and absorption-witness analyses linking QRU hyperparameters to Fourier behavior.

**Summary:**  
This article benchmarks QRU, PQC, VQC, and QRB architectures on chaotic and real-world datasets, showing that QRUs combine stability and expressivity suitable for streaming-data forecasting on NISQ hardware.
