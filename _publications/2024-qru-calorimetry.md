abstract: >
  We present a single-qubit Quantum Re-Uploading Unit (QRU) model applied to particle classification tasks in calorimetric experiments.
  The QRU achieves 98% accuracy on a new LHC-inspired dataset while remaining hardware-efficient for NISQ devices.
  A complete Fourier and hyperparameter analysis demonstrates that QRUs are inherently more expressive than VQCs.

**Summary:**  
This work introduces a realistic single-qubit QRU benchmark for calorimetric particle identification.  
It establishes a mathematical link between circuit depth, Fourier frequency support, and expressivity, showing that QRUs outperform classical and quantum baselines under severe qubit constraints.
