# About Me

I am a **PhD candidate in Quantum Machine Learning for Data Streams**, conducting a cotutelle between the **University of Waikato (New Zealand)** and the **École Polytechnique / Institut Polytechnique de Paris (France)**, under the supervision of **Prof. Albert Bifet**, **Prof. Bernhard Pfahringer**, and **Dr. Frédéric Magniette**.  
My research lies at the intersection of **quantum information**, **machine learning**, and **complex systems**, with a focus on how *quantum re-uploading* mechanisms can enhance expressivity and efficiency in learning from continuous data streams.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My work explores **Quantum Re-Uploading Units (QRU)** and **Quantum Residual Blocks (QRB)**—two minimal yet expressive quantum architectures designed for low-depth, noise-resilient learning.  
The goal is to understand *how much functional complexity a shallow quantum model can encode*, and how Fourier-based analysis can reveal its spectral capacity.

The thesis is structured around three core research questions:

1. **Applications (RQ1)** – Applying QRUs to:
   - Particle classification and energy regression in LHC calorimetry  
   - Chaotic and environmental time-series forecasting  
   - Streaming and flood-risk prediction using QRU + QRB hybrids  

2. **Theory (RQ2)** – Studying the mathematics of expressivity:
   - QRU as a built-in quantum non-linearity within a loss function  
   - Gradient and trainability analysis  
   - Fourier-spectral decomposition of quantum models  

3. **Streaming & Decision (RQ3)** – Integrating QRUs into decision-making loops:
   - Reinforcement-learning agents for real-time bus scheduling (Salvador, Brazil)  
   - QRU → QAOA → CVaR pipeline for parametric-insurance optimization (World Bank GIC Track)  
   - Quantum-LSTM prototypes for sequential prediction

## 🌍 Vision

Beyond the technical layer, I aim to design **quantum models that are not only expressive but also explainable and deployable** in real-world data streams—bridging physics-inspired modeling and sustainable AI.  
This includes exploring **Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)** for spatial downscaling, **quantum optimization** (QAOA) for portfolio allocation, and **hybrid quantum-classical pipelines** for climate-risk management.

## 🧭 Background

Before my PhD, I studied **fundamental and quantum physics** in France (Montpellier and Toulouse), and worked on **NV-center experiments**, **Bell-inequality violations**, and **quantum chaos**.  
I now live in **Christchurch (NZ)**, where I also teach French language and culture at the **Alliance Française** and local Montessori & Steiner schools.
